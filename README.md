###WetMaths is an educational app to learn the multiplication tables. ###

3 Players using an Android App and a Arduino Based device that will launch a little party foam spray to the player that loses

[![WetMaths Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/A47k1j1MHRI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A47k1j1MHRI)

The repo for the Android App:

  https://github.com/amenoni/wetMaths-Android

The code for the Linux side server is in this repo:

https://github.com/amenoni/wetMaths-Linino/tree/master/wetmaths


In this repo you will find the arduino code that controls the servos that triggers the foam spray and the servo that controls the turret that aims each player.

Also will find all 3D printable designs an the electronics diagrams
